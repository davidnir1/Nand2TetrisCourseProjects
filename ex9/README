Remarks

Explanation on how we implemented this game:

First of all, we implemented a two-way linked list that represents the snake's body,
in order to be able to remove the last node in O(1) complexity and allow flexibility with the size of the list.
For that reason, we did not use the Array class, but we used any other class in the standard library.

After game execution, a welcome screen with the game instructions is shown.
User can choose a wanted game speed and then press enter/space in order to start the game,
or press escape in order to quit.

We also decided to implement a food-poop system, which make the snake poop after he ate some amount of food.
Note: eating your own poop will reduce your score by 3,
while eating a nand-gate (the food) will add 1 point to your score.

Snake is not allowed to collide (or go through) screen borders, or collide with itself.
In that case, current round is over and the user is transferred to a new windows with his score
and has the possibility to start a new round.
