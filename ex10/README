Remarks
-------
In this project, we built the first part of the JACK compiler - it tokenizes the given JACK code and outputs 
the tokenization result into an XML file.
In the next project this will output VM translated code instead of the XML.
We worked according to the course suggested API, and built the project as future-proof as we can.

Historically Tcl has always stored all intermediate results as strings.
(With 8.0 they're rethinking that.  Of course, Perl rethought that from
the start.)
