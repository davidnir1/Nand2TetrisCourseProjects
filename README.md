# Nand2TetrisCourseProjects
This is a repository which will hold the projects from the second part of the Nand2Tetris course.  
This repository will eventually hold projects 6-12 (the first 5 projects belong to the first part of the course).
In the first part of the course we built the HACK computer platform - a 16 bit computer, from the first NAND gates all the
way up to the actual CPU, RAM, etc.

In the second part of the course we built a compiler which compiles JACK code (an abstract language described and used in
the course) into (eventually) HACK machine language.
We built the compiler using Python and Java as our main tools.
