Remarks:
In this project we implemented 8 classes which are responsible for critical operations which are built in (built in as of now) in the JACK  
language.
These classes are reposnsible for allowing memory manipulation, receiving inputs, screen manipulation etc.
These classes are implemented in the JACK language and wherever possible we implemented code which is as efficient as we can, as these  
basic operations tend to slow programs down significantly if they are not implemented extremely efficiently.
