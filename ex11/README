Remarks
-------
This is the complete version of the Jack Compiler, this is an extension of project 11,
where we implemented a tokenizer and a CompilationEngine which has the capabillity
to compile JACK files into XML files.
This version extended the JackAnalyzer and now allows compilation from JACK
into VM, XML, or both of them at once.
We tried to build it as modular as we can,
so that in the future it would be easier to add support for new target languages,
for example, moving from XML to VM was very convenient and pretty much straight forward.
To choose between VM, XML or BOTH, change the relevant field in the main method in JackAnalyzer.
